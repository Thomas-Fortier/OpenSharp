# Specification Quality Checklist: OpenShift Client Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The three scope-defining decisions the user explicitly raised (implementation approach,
  MVP resource breadth, operation types) were resolved with the user before finalizing and
  are recorded in the spec's Research & Decisions section — no open clarifications remain.
- The Research & Decisions and Assumptions sections name the chosen technical approach (a
  native client layered on the official Kubernetes .NET client) because the user explicitly
  requested a build-vs-wrap recommendation. Detailed technology choices remain deferred to
  `/speckit-plan`; the Functional Requirements and Success Criteria themselves stay outcome-
  focused.
